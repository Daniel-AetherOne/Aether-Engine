Aether Engine

Aether Engine is a modular AI decision and automation engine designed to power vertical-specific AI applications.
It focuses on turning real-world inputs (images, text, forms, signals) into fast, explainable decisions through a combination of computer vision, LLMs and rule-based logic.

The engine is built with production use in mind: extensible, API-first, and adaptable across multiple industries.

Core Idea

Aether Engine acts as a decision layer between raw input and actionable output.

Instead of building one-off AI scripts, the engine provides a structured approach to:

intake

AI reasoning

business logic

output generation

This allows AI-driven products to scale beyond experiments and into real workflows.

Example Vertical: Paintly

Paintly is a vertical built on top of Aether Engine for professional painters.

What it does

Customers submit photos and basic project information

Computer vision analyzes surfaces and context

Decision logic estimates scope and complexity

A price estimation is generated automatically

Impact

Quote turnaround reduced from hours or days to 2–5 minutes

Consistent and explainable estimates

Lower manual workload for contractors

Paintly demonstrates how Aether Engine can be used to turn unstructured input into reliable, production-ready decisions.

Other Potential Verticals

The engine is designed to support multiple domains, such as:

construction and renovation estimating

inspection and damage assessment

service pricing and intake automation

document and image-based decision systems

Each vertical can define its own rules, models and outputs while reusing the same core engine.

Project Status

This repository represents an actively developed engine and serves as a foundation for applied AI products.
It is not a research project, but a practical system aimed at production use.

Why This Project

Aether Engine was built to explore how AI systems can:

move beyond notebooks and demos

deliver measurable business value

remain maintainable and explainable as they scale
